# mathandprogramming with SymPy

Companion notebooks for Jeremy Kun’s *A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics*, implemented in Python with **SymPy**.

## Goal

This repo has two goals:

1. **Understand the math** by working through the book’s ideas and exercises (pencil-and-paper first).
2. **Translate that understanding into code** using a well-supported toolchain—primarily SymPy—so the concepts become executable, testable, and reusable.

## What’s inside

These notebooks are meant to be read alongside the book. They use SymPy to bridge the gap between:

- the book’s mathematical definitions and proofs  
- your own “from scratch” Python implementations  
- and the idiomatic ways the Python ecosystem represents and manipulates the same objects (polynomials, functions, sets, etc.)

A common pain point is: *“I understand the concept—how do I express it in Python without reinventing everything?”*  
This repo focuses on that translation layer.

## How to use

Read the book, try the exercises by hand, then use the notebooks to:
- validate intuition with computation,
- explore examples,
- and learn the SymPy objects/methods that correspond to the math you just learned.
